This is a Chrome extension that changes a random percentage of links on Google and Wikipedia to Rickrolls

Here's a link the this in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rick-rollette/bonjmjpebjhpdhpnfkkfohhgccjdddco)

Google has some good APIs for extension development. Here's Google's Chrome extensions [tutorial](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted).
